### About Evrmore

Thank you to Satoshi Nakamoto and all the Bitcoin developers for Bitcoin. Thank you Bruce Fenton, Tron Black, BlondFrogs and all the Evrmore developers for Evrmore.

Evrmore (EVR) is a blockchain DeFi (decentralized finance) platform with built-in asset and DeFi primitives. Evrmore is based on the Bitcoin (BTC) UTXO model, is mined publicly and transparently using Proof-of-Work, is free and open source and is open for use and development in any jurisdiction. Evrmore is built as a code and UTXO fork of Evrmore (RVN) and grew out of DeFi discussions and research within the Evrmore community. Evrmore employs full replay protection and forks Evrmore’s coins but not assets. It takes additional measures to protect Evrmore because it seeks not to replace Evrmore, but to co-exist with a different purpose. Evrmore extended the Bitcoin UTXO model with asset primitives thereby eliminating errors commonly caused by implementing assets as "colored coins.” Evrmore similarly extends the Bitcoin UTXO model with DeFi primitives thereby eliminating errors commonly caused by implementing DeFi in general-purpose smart contracts – implementing DeFi functionality using powerful and general-purpose smart contracts is not the correct solution. In addition to DeFi primitives, Evrmore includes features that improve transaction speed, flexibility, zero-confirmation, minimal transaction fees, scaling and complex covenant financial derivatives. Evrmore also includes code development financing and uses the Ethash algo to keep hardware requirements affordable and competitive  

### Mining

#### Evrcore Mainnet uses evrprogpow GPU Proof-of-Work mining

#### See https://github.com/EvrmoreOrg/evrprogpowminer for the GPU solo miner to core (no straturm proxy needed).
